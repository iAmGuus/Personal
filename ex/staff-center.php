<center><h1>Player Moderators</h1></center>
<h3>Do Player Moderators have to help me?</h3>
<body>
Player Moderators are there to help monitor fair play in the game. It is up to the individual Player Moderator whether they offer in-game assistance and they are under no obligation to do this. Their role is merely to report offenses as, and when, they see them.
</body>
<h3>How does someone become a Player Moderator?</h3>
<body>
We keep track of potential Player Moderators through a variety of methods.<br><br>We review their behaviour in the forums, the number and quality of abuse reports sent in, how useful and friendly they have been to other players and any messages sent in to us from other players about their behaviour in the game.<br><br>The chances of a particular player becoming a Player Moderator is not based on their combat level or total level of their character but on the maturity and behaviour of all their characters in the game. This means that while you will not see a player fresh from Tutorial Island given Player Moderator status, you may see some with lower combat levels than you are expecting. Remember that we do investigate accounts fully before giving them Player Moderator status, so if you see the crown, the player will have earned it.<br><br>We do not give out details on how close someone is getting to becoming a Moderator but rest assured that if you are doing what is needed to become a Player Moderator then we will take notice.<br><br>If you do get selected to be a Moderator, a message will be sent to your account. Once you have accepted and the confirmation has been received, you will get your silver crown and Moderator abilities.<br><br>All our Player Moderators are hand-picked by Gucci and Zach. We <b>DO NOT</b> consider requests to become Moderators, so please do not send any in. The best advice we can give someone wanting to become a Player Moderator is to continue playing BrainScape in a good and honest way and report genuine abuse as and when you see it. In addition to this, having a positive presence on our official Forums would increase your chances of being identified as a trustworthy player.<br><br>We do not accept recommendations from players for possible Player Moderators so again, please <b>DO NOT</b> send these in to us. If a player proves themselves worthy, we will take note and may offer them a position as a Player Moderator.<br><br>If you have a previous punishment this does not necessarily end your chances of becoming a Player Moderator. We take into account the time at which an offense took place and the player's subsequent behaviour. If this indicates that they have learnt from their mistakes and have made a positive impact on the game, it can result in the player being considered for the role of Player Moderator.
</body>
<h3>What should I do if a Player Moderator is abusive to me?</h3>
<body>
If you see a Player Moderator being abusive to someone then you should report the event using the Report Abuse button. We will then investigate the matter and take any appropriate action. If, however, we find that a player has falsely reported a Player Moderator we will take action against that person.
</body>
<center><h1>Forum Moderators</h1></center>
<h3>How do I become a Forum Moderator?</h3>
<body>
Forum Moderators will be selected by BrainScape staff only. Please do not ask about becoming a Forum Moderator via the forums themselves or a Customer Support query. Such requests may reduce your chances of being chosen.<br><br>Forum Moderators are normal players, not BrainScape employees, who have been hand-picked by BrainScape, as they have managed to prove consistently that they have the temperament and judgement needed to help us monitor fairness and rule-breakers in the forums.<br><br>The best way to maximise your chances of being asked to become a Forum Moderator is to carry on posting in the forums in accordance with the various rules and being helpful and friendly to other players less experienced than yourself. We also expect any future Forum Moderators to be able to express their opinions clearly.
</body>
<h3>What benefits do Forum Moderators receive?</h3>
<body>
Forum Moderators receive no benefits above those of normal players, other than a Moderator Icon on their posts in the Forums and the powers necessary to moderate the Forums.
</body>
<center><h1>BrainScape Moderators</h1></center>
<h3>Can I trade with a Jagex staff Moderator?</h3>
<body>
BrainScape Moderators <b>CANNOT</b> trade items or money with other players under any circumstances or for any reason.
</body>
No, we <b>CANNOT</b> give out free items or money in game for <b>ANY</b> reason. <b>DO NOT</b> ask us for free items or money in game as this just stops us answering more relevant questions from other players.
</body>
BrainScape Moderators <b>CANNOT</b> trade items or money with other players under any circumstances or for any reason.
</body>
<h3>Do BrainScape Moderators play the game?</h3>
<body>
Yes, many of our BrainScape Moderators are keen players with high-level characters and skills. It should be noted that we do not play the game on our BrainScape Moderator characters, but rather on normal ones; otherwise it would spoil the challenge and fun of earning our levels and enjoying finished quests. Unfortunately we cannot give out the names of our personal characters as this may jeopardise our privacy.<br><br>Remember that no actual member of BrainScape staff will tell you that they are a BrainScape Moderator on their normal character, so if you see someone saying this you should report them.
